            <li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</li>
                <p>Sylvie Lee, Com Des with a Comp Sci double major, junior</p>
            <li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li>
                <p>This is a required class for my major, but I am interested in learning more about web development and improving my skills in that. I also think it is a good way to merge my interest in computer science and art.</p>
            <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li>
                <p>Yes, I took Web Development last semester. I also have some experience coding in other languages from other comp sci classes.</p>
            <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>
                <p>I hope I will learn new skills beyond what I have learned already in Web Development and to get better at using CSS as I need improving. I also hope to learn more about the design aspect of creating websites.</p>
            <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>
                <p>The way that you interact with scale is different since designs are confined to the size of a screen but can be enlarged in a way that physical artwork cannot be.</p>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li>
                <p>I think that <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">monkeytype</a> is really well designed website&#8212;everything is easy to find and use, and it looks really pretty. There are also tons of features and ways to customize your experience.</p>
            <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hug">Wikipedia</a> is a website that works well. It is simple in its design but makes for a pleasant reading experience as it is well organized and easy to navigate.</p>
